    on the surface, and an optional third coordinate can define points above or
    below that surface.

    Required attributes:
        origin          the waypoint of the path defining the surface's center.
        frame           the wayframe of the frame in which the surface is
                        defined.

                        mask or coordinate definition; these classes should

        Return:         a tuple (surface_event, link_event).

            surface_event
                        the event on the surface that matches the light travel
                        time from the link event. This event is defined in the
                        frame of the surface and relative to the surface's
                        origin.

                        The surface event also contains three Scalar subfields,
                        "coord1", "coord2", and "coord3", containing the surface
                        coordinates at the intercept point (and their optional
                        derivatives).

            link_event  a copy of the given event, with the photon travel time
                        filled in.

            If sign is +1, then these subfields and derivatives are defined.
                In surface_event:
                    arr         direction of the arriving photon at the surface.
                    arr_lt      (negative) light travel time from the link
                                event to the surface.
                In link_event:
                    dep_lt      light travel time between the events.

            If sign is -1, then 'arr' and 'dep' are swapped for the two events.
            Note that subfield 'arr_lt' is always negative and 'dep_lt' is
            always positive. Subfields 'arr' and 'dep' have the same direction
            in both events.

        Convergence parameters are as follows:
            max_iterations  the maximum number of iterations of Newton's method
                            to perform. It should almost never need to be > 6.
            dlt_precision   iteration stops when the largest change in light
                            travel time between one iteration and the next falls
                            below this threshold (in seconds).
            dlt_limit       the maximum allowed absolute value of the change in
                            light travel time from the nominal range calculated
                            initially. Changes in light travel with absolute
                            values larger than this limit are clipped. This
                            prevents the divergence of the solution in some
                            cases.

        Return:         a tuple of two Events (surface_event, link_event).

            surface_event
                        the event on the surface that matches the light travel
                        time from the link event. This is event is defined in
                        the frame of the surface and relative to the surface's
                        origin.

            link_event  a copy of the given event, with the photon arrival or
                        departure line of sight and light travel time filled in.

            If sign is +1, then these subfields and derivatives are defined.
                In surface_event:
                    arr         direction of the arriving photon at the surface.
                    arr_lt      (negative) light travel time from the link
                                event to the surface.
                In link_event:
                    dep         direction of the departing photon at the event.
                    dep_lt      light travel time between the events.

            If sign is -1, then 'arr' and 'dep' are swapped for the two events.
            Note that subfield 'arr_lt' is always negative and 'dep_lt' is
            always positive. Subfields 'arr' and 'dep' have the same direction
            in both events.

        Convergence parameters are as follows:
            max_iterations  the maximum number of iterations of Newton's method
                            to perform. It should almost never need to be > 6.
            dlt_precision   iteration stops when the largest change in light
                            travel time between one iteration and the next falls
                            below this threshold (in seconds).
            dlt_limit       the maximum allowed absolute value of the change in
                            light travel time from the nominal range calculated
                            initially. Changes in light travel with absolute
                            values larger than this limit are clipped. This
                            prevents the divergence of the solution in some
                            cases.

        Return:         a tuple (surface_event, link_event).

            surface_event
                        the event on the surface that matches the light travel
                        time from the link event. This is event is defined in
                        the frame of the surface and relative to the surface's
                        origin.

                        The surface event also contains three Scalar subfields,
                        "coord1", "coord2", and "coord3", containing the surface
                        coordinates at the intercept point (and their optional
                        derivatives).

            link_event  a copy of the given event, with the photon vector and
                        travel time filled in.

            If sign is +1, then these subfields and derivatives are defined.
                In path_event:
                    arr         direction of the arriving photon at the surface.
                    arr_ap      apparent direction of the arriving photon.
                    arr_lt      (negative) light travel time from the link
                                event to the surface.
                In link_event:
                    dep         departing photon direction to the surface.
                    dep_ap      apparent direction of the departing photon.
                    dep_lt      light travel time between the events.

            If sign is -1, then 'arr' and 'dep' are swapped for the two events.
            Note that subfield 'arr_lt' is always negative and 'dep_lt' is
            always positive. Subfields 'arr' and 'dep' have the same direction
            in both events.

            The subfields coord1, coord2, and coord3 are always defined in the
            surface event. These provide the coordinates of the surface
            intercept point.

        Convergence parameters are as follows:
            max_iterations  the maximum number of iterations of Newton's method
                            to perform. It should almost never need to be > 6.
            dlt_precision   iteration stops when the largest change in light
                            travel time between one iteration and the next falls
                            below this threshold (in seconds).
            dlt_limit       the maximum allowed absolute value of the change in
                            light travel time from the nominal range calculated
                            initially. Changes in light travel with absolute
                            values larger than this limit are clipped. This
                            prevents the divergence of the solution in some
                            cases.

        Return:         a tuple (surface_event, link_event).

            surface_event
                        the event on the surface that matches the light travel
                        time from the linked path. This is event is defined in
                        the frame of the surface and relative to the surface's
                        origin.

                        The surface event also contains three Scalar subfields,
                        "coord1", "coord2", and "coord3", containing the surface
                        coordinates at the intercept point (and their optional
                        derivatives).

            path_event  the event at the remote path.

            If sign is +1, then these subfields and derivatives are defined.
                In surface_event:
                    dep         departing photon direction at the surface.
                    dep_ap      apparent direction of the departing photon.
                    dep_lt      light travel time between the events.

                In path_event:
                    arr         direction of the arriving photon from the
                                surface.
                    arr_ap      apparent direction of the arriving photon.
                    arr_lt      (negative) light travel time between the events.

            If sign is -1, then 'arr' and 'dep' are swapped for the two events.
            Note that subfield 'arr_lt' is always negative and 'dep_lt' is
            always positive. Subfields 'arr' and 'dep' have the same direction
            in both events.

        Convergence parameters are as follows:
            max_iterations  the maximum number of iterations of Newton's method
                            to perform. It should almost never need to be > 6.
            dlt_precision   iteration stops when the largest change in light
                            travel time between one iteration and the next falls
                            below this threshold (in seconds).
            dlt_limit       the maximum allowed absolute value of the change in
                            light travel time from the nominal range calculated
                            initially. Changes in light travel with absolute
                            values larger than this limit are clipped. This
                            prevents the divergence of the solution in some
                            cases.
